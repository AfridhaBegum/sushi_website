# Sushi Website

I developed a responsive sushi restaurant website using HTML and CSS, featuring a clean and modern design. The website showcases a menu, trending foods,customer ratings and elegant layout inspired by Japanese aesthetics. Smooth animations enhance the user experience, and the fully responsive design ensures seamless accessibility across all devices.
